Here we store a map of remainder to index found, because as same as subarray sum equals k methodology, we traverse through the cumulative sum of each index and if we calculate the remainder at that point, if we see that the same remainder is repeated with the past prefix sum, we can tell that, from the past one , we have added some value that is divisible by k, and this between subarray has sum divisible by k, By this we can say that we found the subarray, but important thing, we have stored the index of every remainder of prefrix sum, because whenever we see the same remainder in the past, we check whether the length of subarray after removing the past remiander prefix sum is greater than 1, because it is mentioned in question. As usual if we dont see the reminader previously, we add the current rem with it's index to our map.
